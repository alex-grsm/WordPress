I believe the purpose of this plugin is to provide **simple** creation of maps on their WordPress sites, using a **basic** Leaflet JS setup.  I **will not accept** pull requests that incorporate any other [Leaflet plugin](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html) into this one, or any copies of them, or any links to them (unless they are completely simplistic and globally usable).  Obviously I don't want to load dependencies for every user of this plugin that only a handful of users want.  

Also, please keep your pull requests limited to one feature/improvement each, as a courtesy to me who has to look through it trying to figure out what does what (and if it works at all).  Any number of bug fixes is completely acceptable. :)
